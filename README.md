# Telecommunication Equipment Control Script

This script is designed to simulate the option of enabling and disabling telecommunication equipment, specifically focusing on the structure of 64 devices called Optimal Network Units (ONUs). Each ONU contains 12 Line Cards (LCs), and each LC has 6 drops that can be enabled or disabled.

## How to Use

1. Open a Unix-like terminal.

2. Clone this repository or download the script file.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script:

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/script
   ```

4. Make the script executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x telecom_control.csh
   ```

5. Run the script:

   ```sh
   ./telecom_control.csh
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions:

   - Choose an option:
     - **Enable ONU range:** Enable a range of ONUs.
     - **Enable all LCs and drops for ONU:** Enable all LCs and drops for a specific ONU.
     - **Disable ONU range:** (Placeholder) Disable a range of ONUs.
     - **Disable all LCs and drops for ONU:** (Placeholder) Disable all LCs and drops for a specific ONU.
     - **Exit:** Quit the script.

   - Enter appropriate values or numbers as prompted.

## Customization

- Replace the comments labeled `# Code to enable ONU`, `# Code to disable ONU`, and so on, with the actual commands or code specific to your telecommunication equipment's management interface or API.

- Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs, such as adding additional features or enhancing error handling.

## Notes

- The C shell (`csh`) is used in this script. However, consider using other shells like Bash (`bash`) or other scripting languages for more advanced scripting tasks.

- This script is intended as a basic example and does not include actual enabling or disabling commands. You'll need to integrate real commands that work with your telecommunication equipment.

- Use caution when enabling or disabling equipment; make sure you understand the impact of your actions.
